## Short Answer (refined)

1) Ways a partner can retire from the firm
- With the consent of all partners (mutual agreement).
- As per the partnership deed, if it expressly permits retirement and terms are followed.
- In a partnership at will, by giving written notice to all partners; retirement is effective on the notice date or the date specified.

2) Matters to adjust at retirement/death
- New profit‑sharing ratio (PSR) and gaining ratio of continuing partners.
- Goodwill: value and compensate retiring/deceased partner (or recognise hidden goodwill if a lump sum exceeds adjusted capital).
- Revaluation of assets and liabilities; record unrecorded items; share net revaluation gain/loss among all partners in old PSR.
- Distribute accumulated profits/losses and reserves (e.g., general reserve, P&L) in old PSR.
- Share of profit/loss up to exit date; interest on capital/drawings; salary/commission due.
- Settle amount due (cash now, loan, or instalments with interest); update capital/loan accounts.
- Optionally align continuing partners’ capitals to new PSR (bring in/withdraw cash).

3) Sacrificing ratio vs Gaining ratio
- Meaning: Sacrifice = old share − new share (mainly on admission). Gain = new share − old share (mainly on retirement/death).
- Effect: Sacrifice reduces future share; Gain increases it.
- Use: Basis for goodwill compensation between partners.
- When: Sacrifice at admission; Gain at retirement/death or whenever PSR changes causing gains.
- Formulae: Sacrificeᵢ = Oldᵢ − Newᵢ; Gainᵢ = Newᵢ − Oldᵢ.

4) Why revalue assets and reassess liabilities on retirement/death
- To settle fairly: reflect current values and unrecorded items so the exiting partner bears/receives the correct share of changes up to exit.

5) Why the retiring/deceased partner is entitled to a share of goodwill
- Goodwill is created by joint efforts; on exit the partner surrenders future benefits and must be compensated for their share (by valuation or hidden goodwill).

## Long Answer outlines (concise)

A) Modes of payment to a retiring partner
- Immediate full cash/bank payment.
- Transfer due amount to Retiring Partner’s Loan A/c (paid later, typically with interest).
- Part cash now + balance as loan; or instalments with interest; interest/terms per deed or statutory default.
- Key entries:
  - Retiring Partner’s Capital Dr → Bank (cash paid)
  - Retiring Partner’s Capital Dr → Retiring Partner’s Loan (loan setup)
  - Interest Dr → Retiring Partner’s Loan (interest accrual)
  - Retiring Partner’s Loan Dr → Bank (instalment payment)

B) Compute amount payable to a deceased/retiring partner
- Start with capital + current account (if any).
- Add: share of goodwill; reserves/accumulated profits; revaluation gain; profit till date; interest on capital; salary/commission due.
- Less: debit current balance; accumulated losses/revaluation loss; drawings and interest on drawings; loss till date.
- Result: amount due → pay (cash) and/or transfer to Executor’s/Loan A/c per terms.

C) Treatment of goodwill at retirement/death
- If goodwill not on books: debit gaining partners’ capitals (individually) in gaining ratio; credit retiring/deceased partner’s capital with their share.
- If goodwill already on books: write off existing goodwill among all partners in old PSR; then adjust for current valuation via gaining ratio.
- Hidden goodwill: if settlement exceeds adjusted dues, excess is treated as goodwill and debited to gaining partners in gaining ratio.

D) Methods to compute share of profit for the intervening period
- Based on last year’s profit: Share = Last year profit × (months till exit/12) × partner’s old share.
- Based on average of past few years: Use average profit instead of last year profit.
- Based on sales: Profit = Last year profit × (sales till exit / last year sales); then multiply by partner’s share.
- Post as: Profit & Loss Suspense Dr → Deceased/Retiring Partner’s Capital; later allocate suspense to gaining partners in gaining ratio (or debit gaining partners directly).

## Quick formulas and reminders
- New PSR: If continuing partners acquire in old PSR, their mutual PSR stays the same; else, Newᵢ = Oldᵢ + share acquired from outgoing partner.
- Gaining ratio: Gainᵢ = Newᵢ − Oldᵢ (use to allocate goodwill compensation and P&L suspense where applicable).
- Revaluation journal patterns: Increase in assets or decrease in liabilities → Revaluation Cr; Decrease in assets or increase in liabilities → Revaluation Dr; Transfer Revaluation profit/loss to all partners in old PSR.
- Capital alignment: Decide target total capital; allocate by new PSR; partners bring in/withdraw cash to match.
