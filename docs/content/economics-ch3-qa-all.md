Concise, book-specific answers. MCQ keys included; numericals show given answers where available. Use alongside your textbook for full context and workings.

## A) Test your Understanding – I (MCQs: keys)
1. (b)
2. (c)
3. (b)
4. (a)

## B) Do It Yourself — Short/Conceptual

1) Distinguish: Gaining ratio vs Sacrificing ratio
- Meaning: Gain = New − Old (retirement/death); Sacrifice = Old − New (admission)
- Effect: Gain increases future share; Sacrifice reduces it
- Use: Basis for goodwill compensation
- When: Gain at retirement/death; Sacrifice at admission
- Formulae: Gainᵢ = Newᵢ − Oldᵢ; Sacrificeᵢ = Oldᵢ − Newᵢ

2) Gaining ratio practice
- (1) Anita, Jaya, Nisha 1:1:1; Jaya retires; new PSR Anita:Nisha = 4:3 → Gaining ratio = 5:2
- (2) Azad:Vijay:Amit = 1/4:1/8:10/16 (=4:2:10)
  - (a) Azad retires → New PSR V:Ami = 1:5; Gaining ratio = 1:5
  - (b) Vijay retires → New PSR Az:Ami = 2:5; Gaining ratio = 2:5
  - (c) Amit retires → New PSR Az:Vij = 2:1; Gaining ratio = 2:1
- (3) See gains above (equal to acquisition ratios of retiring partner’s share)
- (4) Anu, Prabha, Milli; Anu retires:
  - (a) If Prabha:Milli acquire 5:3 → New PSR = Old (each) + (Anu’s share × 5:3)
  - (b) If acquired equally → New PSR = Old (each) + (Anu’s share ÷ 2)
- (5) Rahul, Robin, Rajesh 3:2:1 → New PSR when one retires: (i) 2:1 (ii) 3:1 (iii) 3:2
- (6) Puja, Priya, Pratistha 5:3:2; Priya retires; share taken 2:1 → New PSR Puja:Pratistha = 7:3
- (7) Ashok, Anil, Ajay 1/3, 2/10, 1/5; Anil retires; new PSR 3:2 → Gaining ratio = 4:3

3) Revaluation and Reserves (concept)
- Revalue assets/liabilities; bring unrecorded items; transfer net revaluation gain/loss to all partners in old PSR
- Distribute accumulated profits/losses (e.g., General Reserve, P&L) in old PSR

4) Share of profit for intervening period (concept)
- Methods: last-year profit basis; average profit basis; sales-based apportionment; post via P&L Suspense → deceased/retiring partner; allocate suspense to gaining partners

5) Settlement modes (concept)
- Pay in full; convert to Loan A/c; instalments with interest; show loan on balance sheet until cleared

## C) Test your Understanding – II (MCQs: keys)
1. (a)
2. (a)
3. (c)
4. (b)

## D) Questions for Practice — Short Answer (crisp answers)
1) Ways a partner can retire from the firm
- By consent of all partners [s.32(1)(a)]; as per deed if permitted [s.32(1)(b)]; in a partnership at will, by written notice to all partners [s.32(1)(c), s.7]

2) Matters needing adjustment at retirement/death
- New PSR and gaining ratio; goodwill valuation/adjustment; revaluation of assets/liabilities and unrecorded items; distribution of reserves/P&L; share of profit/loss till date; interest on capital/drawings; salary/commission; settlement (cash/loan) and capital alignment

3) Sacrificing vs gaining ratio
- See B(1) above (meaning, effect, use, formulae)

4) Why revalue assets/liabilities at retirement/death
- Ensure fair settlement: reflect current values and unrecorded items so exiting partner receives/bears correct share

5) Why the retiring/deceased partner is entitled to goodwill share
- Goodwill is jointly created; on exit the partner relinquishes future benefits and must be compensated for their share

## E) Questions for Practice — Long Answer (outline points)
1) Modes of payment to a retiring partner
- Full cash; loan account; part cash + balance as loan; instalments with interest; journal entries for each

2) Compute amount payable to a deceased partner
- Start: capital/current; add goodwill, reserves, revaluation gain, profit till date, IOC, salary/commission; less revaluation loss, accumulated loss, drawings and IOD; settle via executor/loan

3) Treatment of goodwill at retirement/death
- If not on books: debit gaining partners (gaining ratio), credit retiring/deceased; if on books: write off old goodwill in old PSR, then adjust for change; hidden goodwill when settlement exceeds adjusted dues

4) Methods to compute share of profit for intervening period
- Last-year profit; average profit; sales‑based; post via P&L Suspense and allocate to gaining partners
