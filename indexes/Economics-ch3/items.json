You have learnt that retirement or death of a partner also leads to reconstitution of a partnership firm. On the retirement or death of a partner, the existing partnership deed comes to an end, and in its place, a new partnership deed needs to be framed whereby, the remaining partners continue to do their business on changed terms and conditions.

There is not much difference in the accounting treatment at the time of retirement or in the event of death. In both the cases, we are required to determine the sum due to the retiring partner (in case of retirement) and to the legal representatives (in case of deceased partner) after making necessary adjustments in respect of goodwill, revaluation of a assets and liabilities and transfer of accumulated profits and losses. In addition, we may also have to compute the new profit sharing’s ratio among the remaining partners and so also their gaining ratio, This covers all these aspects in detail. 3.1 Ascertaining the Amount Due to Retiring/ Deceased Partner The sum due to the retiring partner (in case of retirement) and to the legal representatives/ executors (in case of death) includes: (i) credit balance of his capital account; (ii) credit balance of his current account (if any); (iii) his share of goodwill; (iv) his share of accumulated profits (reserves); (v) his share in the gain of revaluation of assets and liabilities;\n\n108 Acc", "metadata": {"subject": "Economics", "chapter": "3", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "filename": "leac103.pdf", "source_path": "uploads\\c2a92cee-d3ef-4245-ad2c-4f5a711ce57b_leac103.pdf", "chunk_index": 2, "chunk_size": 1200, "chunk_overlap": 200}}, {"id": "7ea05395-6990-4813-b3ae-d675f2e88d40", "text": "dit balance of his current account (if any); (iii) his share of goodwill; (iv) his share of accumulated profits (reserves); (v) his share in the gain of revaluation of assets and liabilities;\n\n108 Accountancy – Partnership Accounts (vi) his share of profits up to the date of retirement/death; (vii) interest on his capital, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death; and (viii) salary/commission, if any, due to him up to the date of retirement/death.

The new share of each of the remaining partner will consist of his own share in the firm plus the share acquired from the retiring /deceased partner. Consider the following situations: (a) normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring or deceased partners in the old profit sharing ratio, and there is no need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them, as it will be same as the old profit sharing ratio among them.

In fact, in the absence of any information regarding profit sharing ratio in which the remaining partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner, it is assumed that they will acquire it in the old profit sharing ratio and so share the future profits in their old ratio. For example, Asha, Deepti and Nisha are partners in a firm sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1. If Deepti retires, the new profit sharing ratio between Asha and Nisha will be 3:1, unless they decide otherwise. (b) The continuing partners may acquire the share in the profits of the retiring/deceased partner in a proportion other than their old ratio, In that case, there is need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them. For example: Naveen, Suresh and Tarun are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3:2. Suresh retires from the firm and his share was\n\nRetirement/Death of a Partner 109 required by Naveen and Tarun in the ratio 2:1.

In that case, again, there is no need to calculate the gaining ratio as it will be the ratio in which they have acquired the share of profit from the retiring deceased partner. The problem of calculating gaining ratio arises primarily when the new profit sharing ratio of the continuing partners is specified. In such a situation, the gaining ratio should be calculated by, deducting the old share of each continuing partners from his new share i.e., new profit share minus old profit share, i.e., new profit share minus old profit share. For example, Amit, Dinesh and Gagan are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2. Dinesh retires. Amit and Gagan decide to share the profits of the new firm in the ratio of 3:2.
