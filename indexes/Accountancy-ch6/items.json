There is also a third important financial statement known as Cash flow statement, which shows inflows and outflows of the cash and cash equivalents. This statement is usually prepared by companies which comes as a tool in the hands of users of financial information to know about the sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents of an enterprise over a period of time from various activities of an enterprise. It has gained substantial importance in the last decade because of its practical utility to the users of financial information. Financial Statement of companies are prepared following the accounting standards prescribed in the companies Act, 2013.

This chapter discusses this technique and explains the method of preparing a cash flow statement for an accounting period. 6.1 Objectives of Cash Flow Statement A Cash flow statement shows inflow and outflow of cash and cash equivalents from various activities of a company during a specific period. The primary objective of cash flow statement is to provide useful information about cash flows (inflows and outflows) of an enterprise during a particular period under various heads, i.e., operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. This information is useful in providing users of financial statements with a basis to assess the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents and the needs of the enterprise to utilise those cash flows.

Cash flow information is useful in assessing the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop models to assess and compare the present value of the future cash flows of different enterprises. It also enhances the comparability of the reporting of operating performance by different enterprises because it eliminates the effects of using different accounting treatments for the same transactions and events.

As per AS-3, ‘Cash’ comprises cash in hand and demand deposits with banks, and ‘Cash equivalents’ means short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. An investment normally qualifies as cash equivalents only when it has a short maturity, of say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Investments in shares are excluded from cash equivalents unless they are in substantial cash equivalents. For example, preference shares o", "metadata": {"subject": "Accountancy", "chapter": "6", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 2, "filename": "leac206.pdf", "source_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Sunil\\llm\\Commerce-gpt5\\uploads\\4f913a57-25c2-406f-9aef-7536df90fbdf_leac206.pdf", "chunk_index": 5, "chunk_size": 1200, "chunk_overlap": 200}}, {"id": "28b85b2d-7492-44d5-a998-6742e8c1a45e", "text": "y, of say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Investments in shares are excluded from cash equivalents unless they are in substantial cash equivalents. For example, preference shares of a company acquired shortly before their specific redemption date, provided there is only insignificant risk of failure of the company to repay the amount at maturity. Similarly, short-term marketable securities which can be readily converted into cash are treated as cash equivalents and is liquidable immediately without considerable change in value. 6.4 Cash Flows ‘Cash Flows’ implies movement of cash in and out due to some non-cash items. Receipt of cash from a non-cash item is termed as cash inflow while cash payment in respect of such items as cash outflow. For example, purchase of machinery by paying cash is cash outflow while sale proceeds received from sale of machinery is cash inflow. Other examples of cash flows include collection of cash from trade receivables, payment to trade payables, payment to employees, receipt of dividend, interest payments, etc. Cash management includes the investment of excess cash in cash equivalents.

As per AS-3, these activities are to be classified into three categories: (1) operating, (2) investing, and (3) financing activities so as to show separately the cash flows generated (or used) by (in) these activities. This helps the users of cash flow statement to assess the impact of these activities on the financial position of an enterprise and also on its cash and cash equivalents.\n\n244 Accountancy: Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements 6.5.1 Cash from Operating Activities Operating activities are the activities that constitute the primary or main activities of an enterprise.

Examples of such transactions are – acquisition of machinery by issue of equity shares or redemption of debentures by issue of equity shares. Such transactions should be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provide all the relevant information about these investing and financing activities.

Also, declared dividend is paid within 30 days of its declaration therefore; it will be paid within the same financial year. Briefly, proposed dividend of previous year after declaration (approved) by the shareholders will be debited to surplus i.e., Balance in Statement of Profit and Loss.

This is so because statement of profit and loss incorporates the effects of all operating activities of an enterprise. However, Statement of Profit and Loss is prepared on accrual basis (and not on cash basis). Moreover, it also includes certain non-operating items such as interest paid, profit/loss on sale of fixed assets, etc.) and non-cash items (such as depreciation, goodwill written-off, divident declared, etc. Therefore, it becomes necessary to adjust the amount of net profit/loss as shown by Statement of Profit and Loss for arriving at cash flows from operating activities.

The above Statement of Profit and Loss shows the amount of net profit of Rs. 30,000. This has to be adjusted for arriving cash flows from operating activities. Let us take various items one by one. 1. Depreciation is a non-cash item and hence, Rs. 5,000 charged as depreciation does not result in any cash flow. Therefore, this amount must be added back to the net profit. 2. Finance costs of Rs. 5,000 is a cash outflow on account of financing activity. Therefore, this amount must also be added back to net profit while calculating cash flows from operating activities.

Hence, this amount must be deducted from the amount of net profit while calculating cash flows from operating activities. The above example gives you an idea as to how various adjustments are made in the amount of net profit/loss. Other important adjustments relate to changes in working capital which are necessary (i.e., items of current assets and current liabilities) to convert net profit/loss which is based on accrual basis into cash flows from operating activities. Therefore, the increase in current assets and decrease in current liabilities are deducted from the operating profit, and the decrease in current assets and increase in current liabilities are added to the operating profit so as to arrive at the exact amount of net cash flow from operating activities.

The treatment of such items depends upon their nature. All investing and financing incomes are to be deducted from the amount of net profits while all such expenses are to be added back.

However, while preparing a cash flow statement, full details of inflows and outflows are given under these heads including the net cash flow (or use). The aggregate of the net ‘cash flows (or use) is worked out and is shown as ‘Net Increase/Decrease in cash and Cash Equivalents’ to which the amount of ‘cash and cash equivalent at the beginning’ is added and thus the amount of ‘cash and cash equivalents at the end’ is arrived at as shown in Exhibit 6.2. This figure will be the same as the total amount of cash in hand, cash at bank and cash equivalants (if any) given in the balance sheet (see Illustrations 7 to 10).
