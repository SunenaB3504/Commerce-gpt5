Thus, ‘merchandising’, ‘selling’ and distribution are all parts of a large number of activities undertaken by a firm, which are collectively called marketing. It may be noted here that marketing is not merely a post-production activity. It includes many activities that are performed even before goods are actually produced, and continue even after the goods have been sold. For example, activities such as identification of customer needs, collection of information for developing the product, designing suitable product package and giving it a brand name are performed before commencement of the actual production. Similarly, many follow up activities are required for maintaining good customer relations for procuring repeat sale. In modern times, emphasis is placed on describing marketing as a social process. It is a process whereby people exchange goods and services for money or for something of value to them.

It is in this sense that this term is being used in day to day language, even today. The other ways in which this term is being used is in the context of a product market (cotton market, gold or share market), geographic market (national and international market), type of buyers (consumer market and industrial market) and the quantity of goods transacted (retail market and wholesale market).

But in modern marketing sense, the term market has a broader meaning. It refers to a set of actual and potential buyers of a product or service. For example, when a fashion designer designs a new dress and offers it for exchange, all the people who are willing to buy and offer some value for it can be stated to be the market for that dress. Similarly, market for fans or bicycles or electric bulbs or shampoos refers to all the actual and potential buyers for these products. Thus, marketing is a social process where in people interact with others, in order to persuade them to act in a particular way, say to purchase a product or a service, rather than forcing them to do so. A careful analysis of the definition shows the following important features of marketing: 1. needs and Wants: The process of marketing helps individuals and groups in obtaining what they need and want. Thus, the primary reason or motivation for people to engage in the process of marketing is to satisfy some of their needs or wants.

In other words, the focus of the marketing process is on satisfaction of the needs and wants of individuals and organisations. A need is a state of felt deprivation or feeling of being deprived of something. If unsatisfied, it leaves a person unhappy and uncomfortable. For example, on getting hungry, we become uncomfortable and start looking for objects that are capable of satisfying our hunger. Needs are basic to human beings and do not pertain to a particular product. Wants, on the other hand, are culturally defined objects that are potential satisfiers of needs. In other words, human needs shaped by such factors as culture, personality and religion are called wants. A basic need for food, for example, may take various forms such as want for dosa and rice for a South Indian and chapatti and vegetables for a North Indian person. A marketer’s job in an organisation is to identify needs of the target customers and develop products and services that satisfy such needs. 2. creating a Market Offering: On the part of the marketers, the effort involves creation of a ‘market offering.

The buyers, however, make buying decisions on their perceptions of the value of the product or service in satisfying their need, in relation to its cost. A product will be purchased only if it is perceived to be giving greatest benefit or value for the money. The job of a marketer, therefore, is to add to the value of the product so that the customers prefer it in relation to the competing products and decide to purchase it. 4. exchange Mechanism: The process of marketing works through the exchange mechanism. The individuals (buyers and sellers) obtain what they need and want through the process of exchange. In other words, the process of marketing involves exchange of products and services for money or something considered valuable by the people. exchange refers to the process through which two or more parties come together to obtain the desired product or service from someone, offering the same by giving something in return.

For any exchange to take place, it is important that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) Involvement of at least two parties viz., the buyer and the seller. (ii) each party should be capable of offering something of value to the other. For example, the seller offers a product and the buyer, money. (iii) each party should have the ability to communicate and deliver the product or service.

Whether the exchange actually takes place or not depends on the suitability of the act of exchange to both the parties, whether it makes the parties better off or at least not worse off. Another important point to be noted is that Marketing is not merely a business phenomena or confined only to business organisations. Marketing activities are equally relevant to non-profit organisations such as hospitals, schools, sports clubs and social and religious organisations. It helps these organisations in achieving their goals such as spreading the message of family planning, improving the literacy standards of people and providing medication to the sick.

As a result, the demand exceeded the supply. Selling was no problem. Anybody who could produce the goods was able to sell. The focus of business activities was, therefore, on production of goods. It was believed that profits could be maximised by producing at large scale, thereby reducing the average cost of production. It was also assumed that consumers would favour those products which were widely available at an affordable price.

From the view point of management function, number of activities are involved, which have been described as below: 1. gathering and analysing Market information: One of the important functions of a marketer is to gather and analyse market information. This is necessary to identify the needs of the customers and take various decisions for the successful marketing of the products and services. This is important for making an analysis of the available opportunities and threats as well as strengths and weaknesses of the organisation and help in deciding what opportunities can best be pursued by it.

With the growth of computers, a new trend has emerged in the collection of market information. More and more companies are using interactive sites on the internet, to gather customer views and opinions, before taking important business decisions. One of the popular TV News Channel (in Hindi) seeks viewers choice (through SMS) on which of the given four or five main news stories Ch_10.indd 251 10-08-2022 10:04:27\n\nBUSINeSS STUDIeS 252 of the day would be broadcasted as detailed story at the prime time, to ensure that the viewers get to listen to the story of their own choice. 2.

He will have to develop a complete marketing plan covering various important aspects including the plan for increasing the level of production, promotion of the products, etc., and specify the action programmes to achieve these objectives. 3. P r o d u c t D e s i g n i n g a n d Development: Another important m a r k e t i n g a c t i v i t y o r d e c i s i o n area relates to product designing and development. The design of the product contributes to making the product attractive to the target customers. A good design can improve performance of a product and also give it a competitive advantage in the market.

Pricing of Product: Price of product refers to the amount of money customers have to pay to obtain a product. Price is an important factor affecting the success or failure of a product in the market. The demand for a product or service is related to its price. Generally lower the price, higher would be the demand for the product and vice-versa. The marketers have to properly analyse the factors determining the price of a product and take several crucial decisions in this respect, including setting the pricing objectives, determining the pricing strategies, determining the price and changing the prices. 9.

As generally the users of products, particularly consumer products are wide spread and geographically separated from the place these are produced, it is necessary to move them to the place where it is needed for consumption or use, For example, tea produced in Assam has to be transported not only within the state but to other far off places like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Jammu and kashmir and Haryana, rajasthan, where it is consumed. A marketing firm has to analyse its transportation needs after taking into consideration various factors such as nature of the product, cost and location of target market and take decisions in respect of mode of transportation to be chosen and other related aspects. 1 2. s t o r a g e o r W a r e h o u s i n g: Usually there is a time gap between the production or procurement of goods and their sale or use.

It may be because of irregular demand for the products such as in the case of woollen garments or raincoats, or there may be irregular supply because of seasonal production such as in the case of agricultural products (sugarcane, rice, wheat, cotton, etc.). In order to maintain smooth flow of products in the market, there is a need for proper storage of the products. Further, there is a need for storage of adequate stock of goods to protect against unavoidable delays in delivery or to meet out contingencies in the demand. In the process of marketing, the function of storage is performed by different agencies such as manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. markeTing mix The marketing mix consists of various elements, which have broadly been classified into four categories, popularly known as four Ps of marketing.

Price: Price is the amount of money customers have to pay to obtain the product. In case of most of the products, level of price affects the level of their demand. The marketers have not only to decide about the objectives of price setting but to analyse the factors determining the price and fix a price for the firm’s products.

The issue before a firm then is to decide what would be the most effective combination of elements to achieve the given objectives. proDuCTs From the customer’s point of view, a product is a bundle of utilities, which is purchased because of its capability to provide satisfaction of certain need. A buyer buys a product or service for what it does for her or the benefit it provides to her. There can be three types of benefits a customer may seek to satisfy from the purchase of a product, viz., (i) functional benefits, (ii) psychological benefits, and (iii) social benefits. For example, the purchase of a motorcycle provides functional utility of transportation, but at the same time satisfies the need for prestige and esteem and provides social benefit by the way of acceptance from a group, by riding a motorbike. Thus, all these aspects should be considered while planning for a product.

He has to decide whether the firm’s products will be marketed under a brand name or a generic name. Generic name refers to the name of the whole class of the product. For example, a book, a wristwatch, tyre, camera, toilet soap, etc. We know that a camera is a lens surrounded by plastic or steel from all sides and having certain other features such as a flash gun and so on. Similarly book is a bunch of papers, which are in a bound form, on which some useful information about a subject is printed. Thus, all products having these characteristics would be called by the generic name such as camera or book. If products were sold by generic names, it would be very difficult for the marketers to distinguish their products from that of their competitors.

Thus, most marketers give a name to their product, which helps in identifying and distinguishing their products from the competitors’ products. This process of giving a name or a sign or a symbol etc., to a product is called branding. The various terms relating to branding are as follows: 1. brand: A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design or some combination of them, used to identify the products— goods or services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of the competitors. For example, some of the common brands are Bata, Lifebuoy, Dunlop, and Parker. Brand is a comprehensive term, which has two components—brand name and brand mark.

It appears in the form of a symbol, design, distinct colour scheme or lettering. 4. Trade Mark: A brand or part of a brand that is given legal protection is called trademark. The protection is given against its use by other firms. Thus the firm, which got its brand registered, gets the exclusive right for its use. In that case, no other firm can use such name or mark in the country. Though branding adds to the cost e.g., to the cost of packaging, labelling, legal protection, and promotion, it provides several advantages to the sellers as well as the consumers. Characteristics of Good Brand Name Choosing the right brand name is not an easy decision. What makes this decision important is the fact that once a brand name is chosen and the product is launched in the market, changing the brand name is very difficult. So, getting it right the first time is very essential. Following are some of the considerations, which should be kept in mind while choosing a brand name.

For example, it was one of the important factors in the success of products like Maggie’s Noodles, Uncle Chips or Crax wafers. Levels of Packaging There can be three different levels of packaging. These are as below: 1. Primary Package: It refers to the product’s immediate container. In some cases, the primary package is kept till the consumer is ready to use the product (e.g., plastic packet for socks); whereas in other cases, it is kept throughout the entire life of the product (e.g., a toothpaste tube, a match box, etc.). 2.

Secondary Packaging: It refers to additional layers of protection that are kept till the product is ready for use, e.g., a tube of shaving cream usually comes in a card board box. When consumers start using the shaving cream, they will dispose off the box but retain the primary tube. 3. Transportation Packaging: It refers to further packaging components necessary for storage, identification or transportation. For example, a toothpaste manufacturer may send the goods to retailers in corrugated boxes containing 10, 20, or 100 units.

(iii) Innovational Opportunity: Some of the recent developments in the area of packaging have completely changed the marketing scene in the country. For example, milk can now be stored for 4-5 days without refrigeration in the recently developed packing materials. Similarly, in the area of pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, etc., lots of new innovations have come in respect of packaging. As a result, the scope for the marketing of such products has increased.

Functions of Packaging As stated above, packaging performs a number of functions in the marketing of goods. Some of the important functions are as follows: (i) Product Identification: Packaging greatly helps in identification of the products. For example, Colgate in red colour, or Ponds cream jar can be easily identified by its package.

Sometimes it may work even better Ch_10.indd 264 1/23/2024 05:45:40 PM\n\nMARkETING 265 than advertising. In self-service stores, this role of packaging becomes all the more important. Labelling A simple looking but important task in the marketing of goods relates to designing the label to be put on the package. The label may vary from a simple tag attached to the product (such as in case of local unbranded products like sugar, wheat, pulses, etc.) indicating some information about the quality or price, to complex graphics that are part of the package, like the ones on branded products. Lables are useful in providing detailed information about the product, its contents, method of use, etc. The various functions performed by a label are as follows: 1. Describe the Product and specify its contents: Let us look at some of the labels of the products used by us in our day to day life.

Package of fast food products like ready to eat Dosa, Idli or Noodles, describe the procedure of cooking these products; the Package of a toothpaste brand lists the ‘Ten Teeth and Gum Problems’, which the product claims to fight with its ‘Complete Germicheck Formula’; the Package of a brand of Coconut Oil describes the product as pure coconut oil with Heena, Amla, Lemon and specifies how these are good for Hair. Thus, one of the most important functions of labels is to describe the product, its usage, cautions in use, etc. and specify its contents. 2.

Other common identification information provided by the labels include name and address of the manufacturer, net weight when packed, manufacturing date, maximum retail price and Batch number. 3. Grading of Products: Another important function performed by labels is to help grading the products into different categories. Sometimes marketers assign different grades to indicate different features or quality of the product. For example, a popular brand of Hair Conditioners comes in different categories for different hair, say for ‘normal hair’ and for other categories. Different type of tea is sold by some brands under Yellow, red and Green Label categories. 4.

A carefully designed label can attract attention and give reason to purchase. We see many product labels providing promotional messages for example, the pack of a popular Amla Hair Oil states, ‘Baalon mein Dum, Life mein Fun’. The label on the package of a brand of Detergent Powder says, ‘keep cloth look good and your machine in top condition’. Labels play important role in sales promotional schemes launched by companies. For example the label on the package of a Shaving Cream mentions, ‘40% Extra Free’ or package of a toothpaste mentioning, ‘Free Toothbrush Inside’, or ‘Save ` 15’. 5.

Thus, labels perform number of important functions relating to communicating with the potential buyers and promoting the sale of the products. Pricing When a product is bought, some money is paid for it. This money represent the sum of values that consumers exchange for the benefit of having or using the product and is referred to as the price of the product. Similarly, money paid for the services such as fare for the transport service, premium for an insurance policy, and fee to a doctor for his medical advise represent the price of these services. Price may therefore be defined as the amount of money paid by a buyer (or received by a seller) in consideration of the purchase of a product or a services.

Pricing is often used as a regulator of the demand of a product. Generally, if the price of a product is increased, i t s d e m a n d c o m e s d o w n, a n d vice-versa. Pricing is considered to be an effective competitive weapon. In the conditions of perfect competition, most of the firms compete with each other on the basis of this factor. It is also the single most important factor affecting the revenue and profits of a firm. Thus, most marketing firms give high importance to the fixation of price for their products and services. Factors affecting Price Determination There are number of factors which affect the fixation of the price of a product. Some of the important factors in this regard are discussed as below: Ch_10.indd 266 1/23/2024 05:45:40 PM\n\nMARkETING 267 1.

This includes the cost of producing, distributing and selling the product. The cost sets the minimum level or the floor price at which the product may be sold. Generally all marketing firms strive to cover all their costs, at least in the long run. In addition, they aim at earning a margin of profit over and above the costs. In certain circumstance, for example, at the time of introducing a new product or while entering a new market, the products may be sold at a price, which does not cover all the costs. But in the long run, a firm cannot survive unless at least all its costs are covered. There are broadly three types of costs: viz., Fixed Costs, Variable Costs and Semi Variable Costs. Fixed costs are those costs, which do not vary with the level of activity of a firm say with the volume of production or sale. For example, rent of a building or salary of a sales manager remains the same whether 1000 units or 10 units are produced in a week. Those costs which vary in direct proportion with the level of activity are called variable costs.

Those costs which vary in direct proportion with the level of activity are called variable costs. For example, the costs of raw material, labour and power are directly related with the quantity of goods produced. Let us say, if the cost of wood for manufacturing one chair comes to ` 100 the cost of wood for 10 chairs would be ` 1000. Obviously, there will be no cost of wood if no chair is produced. Semi variable costs are those costs which vary with the level of activity but not in direct proportion with it. For example, compensation of a sales person may include a fixed salary of say ` 10,000 plus a commission of 5 per cent on sales. With an increase in the volume of sales, the total compensation will increase but not in direct proportion with the change in the volume of sale. Total Costs are the sum total of the fixed, variable and semi-variable costs for the specific level of activity, say volume of sales or quantity produced. 2.

In fact the price must reflect the interest of both the parties to the transaction—the buyer and the seller. The buyer may be ready to pay up to the point where the utility from the product is at least equal to the sacrifice made in terms of the price paid. The seller would, however, try to at least cover the costs. According to the law of demand, consumers usually purchase more units at a low price than at a high price. 3. Extent of Competition in the Market: Between the lower limit and the upper limit where would the price settle down? This is affected by the nature and the degree of competition. The price will tend to reach the upper limit in case there is lesser degree of Ch_10.indd 267 1/23/2024 05:45:40 PM\n\nBUSINESS STUDIES 268 competition while under conditions of free competition, the price will tend to be set at the lowest level Competitors’ prices and their a n t i c i p a t e d r e a c t i o n s m u s t b e considered before fixing the price of a product.

Government and Legal Regulations: In order to protect the interest of public against unfair practices in the field of price fixing, Government can intervene and regulate the price of commodities. Government can declare a product as essential product and regulate its price. For example, the cost of a drug manufactured by a company having monopoly in the production of the same come to ` 20 per strip of ten and the buyer is prepared to pay any amount for it, say ` 200. In the absence of any competitor, the seller may be tempted to extort the maximum amount of ` 200 for the drug and intervene to regulate the price. Usually in such a case, the Government does not allow the firms to charge such a high price and intervene to regulate the price of the drug. This can be done by the Government by declaring the drug as essential commodity and regulating its price. 5.

P r i c i n g O b j e c t i v e s: Pricing objectives are another important factor affecting the fixation of the price of a product or a service. Generally the objective is stated to be maximise the profits. But there is a difference in maximising profit in the short run and in the long run. If the firm decides to maximise profits in the short run, it would tend to charge maximum price for its products. But if it is to maximise its total profit in the long run, it would opt for a lower per unit price so that it can capture larger share of the market and earn greater profits through increased sales. Apart from profit maximisation, the pricing objectives of a firm may include: (a) Obtaining Market Share Leadership: If a firms objective is to obtain larger share of the market; it will keep the price of its products at lower levels so that greater number of people are attracted to purchase the products; (b) Surviving in a Competitive Market: If a firm is facing difficulties in surviving in the m", "metadata": {"subject": "Busness Studies", "chapter": "2", "page_start": 26, "page_end": 26, "filename": "lebs202.pdf", "source_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Sunil\\llm\\Commerce-gpt5\\uploads\\e7d283fc-24fd-49d8-b597-bbe4f5cbde59_lebs202.pdf", "chunk_index": 65, "chunk_size": 1200, "chunk_overlap": 200}}, {"id": "698b0507-1ebb-47ac-9044-50026e442cf5", "text": "e of its products at lower levels so that greater number of people are attracted to purchase the products; (b) Surviving in a Competitive Market: If a firm is facing difficulties in surviving in the market because of intense competition or introduction of a more efficient substitute by a competitor, it may resort to discounting its products or running a promotion campaign to liquidate its stock; and (c) A t t a i n i n g P r o d u c t Q u a l i t y Leadership: In this case, normally higher prices are charged to cover high quality and high cost of research and Development.

This would result in customer dissatisfaction, with the danger of loss of business and goodwill. 2.

The basic purpose of warehousing activities is to arrange placement of goods and provide facilities to store them. The need for warehousing arises because there may be difference between the time a product is produced and the time it is required for consumption. Generally the efficiency of a firm in serving its customers will depend on where these warehouses are located and where are these to be delivered. Generally larger the number of warehouses a firm has, lesser would be the time taken in serving customers at different locations but greater would be the cost of warehousing and vice-versa. Thus the firm has to strike a balance between the cost of warehousing and the level of customer service.

Thus the firm has to strike a balance between the cost of warehousing and the level of customer service. For products requiring long-term storage (such as agricultural products) the warehouses are located near production sites. This helps in minimising the charges on transportation of the goods. On the other hand, the products which are bulky and hard to ship (machinery, automobiles) as well as perishable products (bakery, meat, vegetables) are kept at different locations near the market. 4. Inventory Control: Linked to w a r e h o u s i n g d e c i s i o n s a r e t h e inventory decisions which hold key to success for many manufacturers, especially those where the per unit cost is high. A very important decision in respect of inventory is deciding about the level of inventory.

It is an impersonal form of communication, which is paid for by the marketers (sponsors) to promote some goods or service. The most common modes of advertising are ‘newspapers’, ‘magazines’, ‘television’, and ‘radio’. The important distinguishing features of advertising are as follows: (i) Paid Form: Advertising is a paid form of communication. That is, the sponsor has to bear the cost of communicating with the prospects. (ii) Impersonality: There is no direct face-to-face contact between the prospect and the advertiser. It is therefore, referred to as impersonal method of promotion. Advertising creates a monologue and not a dialogue. (iii) Identified Sponsor: Advertising is undertaken by some identified indivi dua l or compan y, who makes the advertising efforts and also bears the cost of it.

ObjectiOns tO Advertising though advertising is one of the most frequently used medium of promotion of goods and services, it attracts lot of criticism. the opponents of advertising say that the expenditure on advertising is a social waste as it adds to the cost, multiplies the needs of people and undermines social values. the proponents, however, argue that advertising is very useful as it increases the reach, brings the pay unit cost of production down and adds to the growth of the economy. it is therefore, important to examine the major criticisms against advertising and see the extent to which these are true. this is taken up as follows: 1.

Undermines Social Values: Another important criticism of advertising is that it undermines social values and promotes materialism. It breeds discontent among people as they come to know about new products and feel dissatisfied with their present state of affairs. Some advertisements show new life styles, which don’t find social approval. This criticism is not entirely true. Advertisement in fact helps buyers by informing them about the new products, which may be improvement over the existing products. If the buyers are not informed about these products, they may be using inefficient products. Further, the job of an advertisement is to inform. The final choice to buy or not to buy anyway rests with the buyers. They will buy if the advertised product satisfies some of their needs. They may be motivated to work harder to be able to purchase these products. 3.

For example, we may note similar claims of whiteness or stain removing abilities in competing brands of detergent powder or claims of whiteness of tooth or ‘feelings of freshness’ in competing brands of toothpaste that it is sometimes confusing to us as to which one to buy. The supporters of advertisement, however, argue that we are all rational human beings who make our decisions for purchase of products on factors such as price, style, size, etc. Thus the buyers can clear their confusion by analysing the information provided on the advertisements and other sources before taking a decision to purchase a product. However, this criticism cannot be completely overruled. 4.

Role of Public Relations The role of public relations can be discussed with respect to the functions which the department performs. Public relations itself is an important tool in the hands of the marketing department, which can be used to the advantage of the business. The public relations department performs five functions: 1. Publicity: P u b l i c i t y i s s i m i l a r to advertising, in the sense that it is a non-personal form of communication. However, as against advertising it is a non-paid form of communication. Publicity generally takes place when favourable news is presented i n t h e m a s s m e d i a a b o u t a product or service. For example, if a manufacturer achieves a breakthrough by developing a car engine, which runs on water instead of petrol, and this news is covered by television or radio or newspapers in the form of a news item.

Thus, the two important features of publicity are that: (i) Publicity is an unpaid form of communication. It does not involve any direct expenditure by the marketing firm; and (ii) There is no identified sponsor for the communication as the message goes as a news item. In publicity, as the information is disseminated by an independent source, e.g., the press in the form of news stories and features, the message has more credibility than if that comes as a sponsored message in advertising. 2.

This is usually done with the help of newsletter, annual reports, brochures, articles and audio-visual materials. Companies rely on these materials to reach and influence their target markets.

C o u n s e l l i n g: T h e p u b l i c relations department advises the management on general issues which affect the public and the position the company would like to the take on a particular issue. The company can build goodwill by contributing money and time to certain causes like environment, wildlife, children’s rights, education, etc. Such cause-related activities help in promoting public relations and building goodwill.
