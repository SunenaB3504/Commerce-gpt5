Ford has always attracted and nurtured capable managers and technicians, but it has failed to do the same for change agents and leaders. So, as part of the automaker’s cultural overhaul, Ford is embarking on a sweeping attempt to mass-manufacture leaders. It wants to build an army of “warrior-entrepreneurs” — people who have the courage and skills to topple old ideas, and who believe in change passionately enough to make it happen. Ford Motor Company announced key changes to its senior management team as it continues to strengthen its automotive business, improve the company’s operational fitness, and accelerate a strategic shift to capitalize on emerging opportunities. In announcing the leadership changes, Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett said Form is “very fortunate to have an experienced and committed executive team in place to significantly strengthen their business while building towards their vision of becoming the world’s most trusted mobility company.

Business organisations have always given due importance to its managers who are capable of leading others. A manager needs to use various ways to lead, motivate and inspire the subordinates and to communicate with them suitably. These ways, discussed in the present chapter, are collectively called the directing function of management. MeanIng In the ordinary sense, directing means giving instructions and guiding people in doing work. In our daily life, we come across many situations like a hotel owner directing his employees for to complete certain activities teacher organising a directing his student to complete an assignment, a film director directing the artists about how they should act in the film etc. In all these situations, we can observe that directing is done to achieve some predetermined objectiv", "metadata": {"subject": "Busness Studies", "chapter": "7", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "filename": "lebs107.pdf", "source_path": "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Sunil\\llm\\Commerce-gpt5\\uploads\\8e5501b5-6e4f-4038-8392-6ece6d255e21_lebs107.pdf", "chunk_index": 3, "chunk_size": 1200, "chunk_overlap": 200}}, {"id": "4429fcf4-1afe-4510-b567-51171b617ab1", "text": "te an assignment, a film director directing the artists about how they should act in the film etc. In all these situations, we can observe that directing is done to achieve some predetermined objective.

It is one of the key managerial functions performed by every manager. Directing is a managerial process which takes place throughout the life of an organisation. The main characteristics of directing are discussed below: (i) Directing initiates action: Directing is a key managerial function. A manager has to perform this function along with planning, organising, staffing and controlling while discharging his duties in the organisation. While other functions prepare a setting for action, directing initiates action in the organisation.

(ii) Directing takes place at every level of management: Every manager, from top executive to supervisor performs the function of directing. The directing takes place wherever superior – subordinate relations exist. (iii) Directing is a continuous process: Directing is a continuous activity. It takes place throughout the life of the organisation irrespective of people occupying managerial positions. We can observe that in organisations like Infosys, Tata, BHEL, HLL and the managers may change but the directing process continues because without direction the organisational activities can not continue further. (iv) Directing flows from top to bottom: Directing is first initiated at top level and flows to the bottom through organisational hierarchy.

Directing towards achievement of guides common Through objectives. directing, managers not only tell the people in the organisation as to what they should do, when they should do and how they should do but also see that their instructions are implemented in proper perspective. Very often, this becomes an important factor in the efficient and effective functioning of the organisation. The points which emphasise the importance of directing are presented as follows: (i) Directing helps to initiate action by people in the organisation towards attainment of desired objectives. For example, if a supervisor guides his subordinates and clarifies their doubts in performing a task, it will help the worker to achieve work targets given to him. (ii) Directing integrates employees-efforts in the organisation in such a way that every individual effort contributes to the organisational performance. Thus, it ensures that the individuals work for organisational goals.

(iii) Directing guides employees to fully realise their potential and capabilities by motivating and providing effective leadership. A good leader can always identify the potential of his employees and motivate them to extract work up to their full potential. (iv) Directing facilitates introduction of needed changes in the organi-sation. Generally, people have a tendency to resist changes in the organisation. Effective directing through motivation, communication and leadership helps to reduce such resistance and develop required cooperation in introducing changes in the if organisation.

A manager has to deal with people with diverse background, and expectations. This comp licates the directing process. Certain guiding principles of directing may help in directing process. These principles are briefly explained below: (i) Maximum individual contribution: This principle emphasises that directing techniques must help every individual in the organisation to contribute to his maximum potential for achievement of organisational objectives. It should bring out untappted energies of employees for the efficiency of organisation.

For example, a good motivation plan with suitable monetary and non-monetary rewards can motivate an employee to contribute his maximum efforts for the organisation as he or she may feel that their efforts will bring them suitable rewards. (ii) Harmony of objectives: Very often, we find that individual objectives of employees and the organisational objectives as understood are conflicting to each other. For example, an employee may expect attractive salary and monetary benefits to fulfill his personal needs. The organisation may improve expect employees to productivity to achieve expected profits. But, good directing should provide harmony by convincing that employee rewards and work efficiency are complimentary to each other. should (iii) Unity of Command: This principle insists that a person in the organisation receive instructions from one superior only.

She was recognised by her peers and supervisors as a person who managed department in a good way. However, everyone realised that Rashmi was extremely ambitious and was seeking a higher-level management position. When one of her sales representatives did a good job, she would attempt to take the credit. However, if a problem arose, she thought it was not her fault. When the marketing manager retired, Rashmi applied for the position. The company decided to do a thorough search because of the responsibility and importance associated with the position.

What makes people to behave the way they do? Why are some people reluctant to do the work though they have ability to do? What should be done to make people work effectively?

A manager may come across 175 highly committed and hardworking staff or lazy, evasive and superficial workers. He or she may wonder what to do with workers not willing to work to their potential. Psychologists say it is motivation, which stimulates people to take up work voluntarily. Let us try to understand something about motivation. Motivation: Motivation means inci-tement or inducement to act or move. In the context of an organisation, it means the process of making subordinates to act in a desired manner to achieve certain organisational goals. While discussing about motivation, we need to understand three inter related terms — motive, motivation and motivators. Let us try to know about these terms.

(i) Motive: A motive is an inner state that energises, activates or moves and directs behaviour towards goals. Motives arise out of the needs of individuals. Realisation of a motive causes restlessness in the individual which prompts some action to reduce such restlessness. For example, the need for food causes hunger an account of which a man searches for food. Some such motives are – hunger, thirst, security, affiliation, need for comfort, recognition etc., (ii) Motivation: Motivation is the process of stimulating people to action to accomplish desired goals.

Features of Motivation: The ana-lysis of various definitions and viewpoints on motivation reveals the following features of motivation: (i) Motivation is an internal feeling. The urge, drives, desires, aspi-rations, striving or needs of human being, which are internal, influence human behaviour. For example, people may have the urge or desire for possessing a motorbike, comfortable house, reputation in the society. These urges are internal to an individual. (ii) Motivation produces goal directed behaviour. For example, the promotion in the job may be given to employee with the objective of improving his performance. If the employee is interested in promotion, it helps to produce a behaviour to improve performance. (iii) Motivation can be either positive or negative.

Ramu is very hungry since he did not have breakfast in the morning. By1.00 P.M., he became restless and started walking on the road in search of a hotel for snacks or meals. After walking for 2 kms, he could find a hotel where roti and dal was available for ` 10. Since he had only ` 15 in his pocket, he paid ` 10 and had a satisfying meal. After taking a meal, he felt that he had regained energy. An unsatisfied need of an individual creates tension which stimulates his or her drives. These drives generate a search behaviour to satisfy such need. If such need is satisfied, the individual is relieved of tension.

The importance of moti-vation can be pointed out by the following benefits: (i) Motivation helps improve performance levels of employees to as well as the organisation. Since proper motivation satisfies the needs of employees, they in turn devote all their energies for optimum performance in their work. A satisfied employee can always turnout expected performance.

If manager can convince employees that proposed changes will bring additional rewards to employees, they may readily accept the change.

Let us examine it in detail. Abraham Maslow, a well-known psychologist in a classic paper published in 1943, outlined the elements of an overall theory of motivation. His theory was based on human needs. He felt that within every human being, there exists a hierarchy of five needs. These are: (i) Basic Physiological Needs: These needs are most basic in the hierarchy and corresponds to primary needs. Hunger, thirst, shelter, sleep and sex are some examples of these needs. In the organisational context, basic salary helps to satisfy these needs. (ii) Safety/Security Needs: These needs provide security and protection from physical and emotional harm. Examples: job security, stability of income, Pension plans etc., (iii) Affiliation/Belonging Needs: These needs refer to affection, sense of belongingness, acceptance and friendship.

Satisfaction of such needs influences their behaviour. (ii) People’s needs are in hierarchical order, starting from basic needs to other higher level needs.

(iv) A person moves to the next higher level of the hierarchy only when the lower need is satisfied. Maslow’s Theory focuses on the needs as the basis for motivation. This theory is widely recognised and appreciated. However, some of his propositions are questioned on his classification of needs and hierarchy of needs. But, despite such criticism, the theory is still relevant because needs, no matter how they are classified, are important to understand the behaviour. It helps managers to realise that need level of employee should be identified to provide motivation to them.

These incentives may be broadly classified as financial and non financial. Let us learn about these incentives in detail.

Maslow was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1908. He studied primate behavior at the University of Wisconsin, where he received his doctorate in psychology in 1934. Early in his career, Maslow was drawn to the study of human motivation and personality. His work in this area upset strict behaviorists, whose explanations of motivation and personality failed to account for what Maslow called the whole person. His theory of the hierarchy of needs, which leads to the ‘self-actualised’ individual, was a strong catalyst for the founding of humanistic psychology. Maslow successfully bridged motivation and personality in his theories of needs, self-actualising persons, and peak experiences. Maslow is considered an important figure in contemporary psychology. His career was a formidable one. For 14 years he taught at Brooklyn College, and then went to Brandeis University as chairman of the Psychology Department.

(ii) Productivity linked wage incen­ tives: Several wage incentive plans aims at linking payment of wages to increase in productivity at individual or group level. (iii) Bonus: Bonus is an incentive offered over and above the wages/ salary to the employees.

Some of the important non-financial incentives are discussed below: (i) Status: In the organisational context, status means ranking of positions in the organisation. The authority, responsibility, rewards, recognition, perquisites and prestige of job indicate the status given to a person holding a managerial position.

Let us understand the concept of leadership, its importance and qualities of good leaders. Leadership is the process of influencing the behaviour of people by making them strive voluntarily towards achievement of organisational goals. Leadership indicates the ability of an individual to maintain good interpersonal relations with followers and motivate them to contribute for achieving organisational objectives.

Even a laissez faire leader would have certain rules to be followed while doing work and a democratic leader may have to take his own decision in an emergency situation. coMMunIcatIon Communication plays key role in the success of a manager.

It involves systematic and continuous process of telling, listening and understanding. Louis Allen Communication is transfer of information from the sender to the receiver with the information being understood by the receiver. Harold Koontz and Heniz Weihrich Communication is a process by which people create and share information with one another in order to reach common understanding. Rogers Effective Communication increases managerial efficiency The word communication has been derived from the Latin word ‘communis’ which means ‘common’ which consequently implies common understanding.

The process is represented in the figure. The elements involved in commu-nication process are explained below: (i) Sender: Sender means person who conveys his thoughts or ideas to the receiver. The sender represents source of communication. (ii) Message: It is the content of ideas, feelings, suggestions, order, etc., intended to be communicated.

(viii) Noise: Noise means some obstruction or hindrance to communication. This hindrance 189 may be caused to sender, message or receiver. Some examples of noise are: (a) Ambiguous symbols that lead to faulty encoding. (b) A poor telephone connection. (c) An inattentive receiver. (d) Faulty decoding (attaching wrong meanings to message). (e) Prejudices obstructing the poor understanding of message. (f ) Gestures and postures that may distort the message.

It also leads to generate rumours which are not authentic. People’s behaviour is affected by rumours and informal discussions and sometimes may hamper work environment. Sometimes, grapevine channels may be helpful as they carry information rapidly and, therefore, may be useful to the manager at times. Informal channels are used by the managers to transmit information so as to know the reactions of his/her subordinates. An intelligent manager should make use of positive aspects of informal channels and minimise negative aspects of this channel of communication.

Therefore, it is important for a manager to identity such barriers and take measures to overcome them. The barriers to communication in the organisations can be broadly grouped as: semantic barriers, psychological barriers, organisational barriers, and personal barriers.

These are briefly discussed below: Semantic barriers: Semantics is the branch of linguistics dealing with the meaning of words and sentences. Semantic barriers are concerned with problems and obstructions in the process of encoding and decoding of message into words or impressions. Normally, such barriers result on account of use of wrong words, faulty translations, different interpretations, etc. These are discussed below: (i) Badly expressed message: Some times intended meaning may not be conveyed by a manager to his subordinates. These badly expressed messages may be an account of inadequate vocabulary, usage of wrong words, omission of needed words, etc. (ii) Symbols with different meanings: A word may have several mean-ings. Receiver has to perceive one such meaning for the word used by communicator. For example, Communication Grapevine consider these three sentences where the work ‘value’ is used: (a) What is the value of this ring? (b) I value our friendship. (c) What is the value of learning computer skills? You will find that the ‘value’ gives different meaning in different contexts. Wrong perception leads to comm-unication problems.

(iii) Faulty translations: Sometimes the communications originally drafted in one language (e.g., English) need to be translated to the language understandable to workers (e.g., Hindi). If the translator is not proficient with both the languages, mistakes may creep in causing different meanings to the communication. (iv) Unclarified assumptions: Some communications may have certain assumptions which are subject to different interpretations. For example, a boss may instruct his subordinate, “Take care of our guest”. Boss may mean that Ch_07.indd 194 08-08-2022 10:36:01\n\nsubordinate should take care of transport, food, accommodation of the guest until he leaves the place.

If there is no match between what is said and what is expressed in body movements, communications may be wrongly perceived. Psychological barriers: Emotional factors acts as or psychological barriers to communicators. For example, a worried person cannot communicate properly and an angry receiver cannot understand the real meaning of message. The state of mind of both sender and receiver of communication reflects in the effective communication. Some of the psychological barriers are: (i) Premature evaluation: Some times people the meaning of message before the sender completes his message. evaluation Such premature evaluate 195 may be due to pre-conceived notions or prejudices against the communication.

For instance, an employee explains about his problems to the boss who is pre-occupied with an important file before him. The boss does not grasp the message and the employee is disappointed. (iii) Loss by transmission and poor retention: When communication passes through various levels, successive of the message results in loss of, or transmission of inaccurate information. This is more so in case of oral communication. Poor retention is another problem. Usually people cannot retain the information for a long time if they are inattentive or not interested. transmissions (iv) Distrust: Distrust between comm-unicator communicate and acts as a barrier.

Supervision is very important as it is closely linked to overseeing the work, guiding and ensuring that targets are met by workers and employees. Motivation: Motivation is the process of stimulating people to action to accomplish desired goals of organisation. It is an internal feeling of an individual and leads to goal directed behaviour. Motivation is mainly based on needs of individuals. It helps individuals and groups in the organisation for improved performance. Managers offer incentives to employees both financial and non financial. Financial incentives are monetary and may be in the form of salary, bonus, profit sharing, pension, etc. Non financial incentives provide social and psychological satisfaction.

A manager should learn to manage with informal communication also. In most of the organisations, several barriers may exist for effective communications. Some of these barriers include – semantic barriers, organisational barriers, language barriers, transmission barriers, psychological barriers and personal barriers. Managers should take appropriate measures to overcome these barriers and promote effective communication in the organisation. Exercises Very Short Answer Type 1. What is informal communication? 2.
