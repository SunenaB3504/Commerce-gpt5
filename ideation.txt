				a5.1.1) For Economics :
				The types of questions, based on the provided sources, are primarily categorized by their format, the marks they carry, and their recommended word limits. The entire question paper is divided into two main sections: **Section A – Macro Economics** and **Section B – Indian Economic Development**.

Here is a detailed breakdown of each type:

*   **Multiple Choice Type Questions (MCQ)**
    *   These questions carry **1 mark each**.
    *   There are a total of **20 Multiple Choice Type Questions**.
    *   They come in various formats:
        *   **Standard MCQs**: These typically involve choosing the correct option from a set of alternatives. Examples include identifying a budgetary objective like "Redistribution of income", filling in blanks regarding economic terms such as "Net Product Taxes" or the "flexible" exchange rate system, interpreting diagrams to identify a "Reference Line" at 45 degrees, or identifying the correct type of deficit like "fiscal" deficit. They also involve evaluating the truthfulness of statements, like "Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false" regarding Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC).
        *   **Assertion (A) and Reason (R) Questions**: As discussed, this is a specific type of MCQ. You are presented with an Assertion (a statement) and a Reason (another statement). You must then choose an option that correctly describes the truthfulness of both statements and whether the Reason correctly explains the Assertion. For instance, you might encounter a question where "Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true" concerning government securities and the central bank's role. Another example involves evaluating statements about foreign grants-in-aid and disposal of equity by Public Sector Undertakings.

*   **Short Answer Type Questions (3 Marks)**
    *   Each of these questions is worth **3 marks**.
    *   There are **4 Short Answer Type Questions** of this specific value.
    *   Answers for these questions should be concise, falling within a **60 to 80-word limit**.
    *   Content for these questions often requires brief explanations or justifications. Examples include: categorizing and explaining "Direct Taxes" and "Indirect Taxes", explaining where "Foreign Portfolio Investments" are recorded in the Balance of Payments and defining a "Balance of Payments deficit", critically appraising the "disinvestment policy" or justifying "globalisation as an essential outcome of liberalisation", and discussing the importance of "liberty indicators" in measuring development. Other topics could involve explaining the "Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY)" or identifying sources of workforce data.

*   **Short Answer Type Questions (4 Marks)**
    *   These questions carry **4 marks each**.
    *   There are **6 Short Answer Type Questions** of this type.
    *   The recommended word limit for these answers is **80 to 100 words**.
    *   These questions typically require a more detailed explanation, a short calculation, or a more elaborate justification. Examples include: justifying the derivation of the saving curve from the consumption curve with steps, calculating "Break-even level of income" or "Equilibrium level of income" given specific economic parameters, explaining the working process of the "increase in investment on the National Income" (multiplier effect), discussing the evolution and forms of money, and evaluating the benefits and risks of "Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)". Other questions may involve calculating "percentage change in Real GDP", discussing the impact of "public investment" on GDP and welfare, defending or refuting statements about the classification of final goods, identifying types of capital loss, discussing reforms leading to China's "rapid economic growth", explaining the rationale behind G-20 nations' commitment to "sustainable development", and justifying industrial licensing or discussing estimates of national income during colonial rule.

*   **Long Answer Type Questions (6 Marks)**
    *   Each of these questions is allocated **6 marks**.
    *   The paper contains **4 Long Answer Type Questions** of this type.
    *   Answers are expected to be more comprehensive, with a recommended word limit of **100 to 150 words**.
    *   While the general instructions indicate the presence of 6-mark questions, the specific detailed examples provided in the sources for individual questions primarily extend up to 4 marks. However, a 6-mark question would typically involve a more in-depth analysis, a broader discussion of interconnected concepts, or a more elaborate explanation requiring a lengthier response compared to the shorter answer types.
