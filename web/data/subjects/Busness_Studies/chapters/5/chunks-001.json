One of India’s largest IT solutions providers, Wipro Technologies, is taking on the likes of IBM and Accenture in its effort to be included among the largest and most successful technology services companies in the world. Restructuring Wipro was considered the most important step in becoming a global giant, driven by the goal towards improved customer-orientation. During the past few months, Wipro separated itself into several subsidiaries by product line: telecommunications, financial services, etc. Each subsidiary brings in about $300 million in annual earnings and is self-sufficient with their own accounting books, personnel and administrative functions. engineering, from Wipro a shifted decentralised management responsibilities for growth management of each entity. centralised system. lay with to All the “We tried to de-layer the organisation and empower our business leaders with a much higher degree of growth responsibility,” said Premji. “We removed an entire layer [of executives]”.

Let us try and understand how organising is carried out with the help of an example. Suppose twelve students work for the school library in the summer vacations. One afternoon they are told to unload a shipment of new releases, stock the bookshelves, and then dispose of all waste (packaging, paper etc). If all the students decide to do it in their own way, it will result in mass confusion. However, if one 111 student supervises the work by grouping students, dividing the work, assigning each group their quota and developing reporting relationships among them, the job will be done faster and in a better manner.

Thus, for an organisation to function smoothly and face environmental changes, it becomes necessary to pay attention to its structure. Peter Drucker emphasises on the importance of having an appropriate organisation structure when he says, “organisation structure is an indispensable means; and the wrong structure will seriously impair busi­ ness performance and even destroy it.” The organisation structure can be defined as the framework within which managerial and operating tasks are performed. It specifies the relationships between people, work and resources.

A proper organisation structure is essential to ensure a smooth flow of communication and better control over the operations of a business enterprise. An organisation structure provides the framework which enables the enterprise to function as an integrated unit by regulating and coordinating the responsibilities of individuals and departments.

Mc Kinsey’s mandate was to evolve an organisational structure that was far more responsive to its business needs than that based on business groups. The ONGC system run by functional heads often meant delays exceeding a year in matters requiring urgent decisions on fields. Also, since responsibilities were shared at production platforms between different business groups, the system degenerated into wrangling over responsibilities. Similarly, group loyalties often took precedence over the requirements of tasks. But, most importantly, it was found that the performance evaluation criteria based on business group yardstick were completely at loggerheads with requirements on fields.

A detailed analysis of Louis Allen’s definition brings to light the following essential elements of delegation: (i) Authority: Authority refers to the right of an individual to command his subordinates and to take action within the scope of his position. The concept of authority arises from the established scalar chain which links the various job positions and levels of an organisation. Authority also refers to the right to take decisions inherent in a managerial position to tell people what to do and expect them to do it. In the formal organisation authority originates by virtue of an individual’s position and the extent of authority is highest at the top management levels and reduces successively as we go down the corporate ladder. Thus, authority flows from top to bottom, No delegation leads to delays in decision-making Ch_05.indd 126 08-08-2022 09:50:39\n\n127 Creation of accountability",

However, as we go higher up in the management hierarchy, the scope of authority increases. (ii) Responsibility: Responsibility is the obligation of a subor­dinate to properly perform the assigned duty. It arises from a superior– subordinate relationship because the subor­dinate is bound to perform the duty assigned to him by his superior. Thus, flows upwards, responsibility i.e., a subordinate will always be responsible to his superior. i.e., the superior has authority over the subordinate. Authority relationships helps to maintain order in the organisation by giving the managers the right to exact obedience and give directions to the workforce under them. the Authority determines the superior subordinate relationship wherein the superior communicates his decision expecting subordinate, to compliance the subordinate executes the decision as per",

Thus, for effective delegation the authority granted must be commensurate with the assigned responsibility. If authority granted is more than responsibility, it may lead to misuse of authority, and if responsibility assigned is more than authority it may make a person ineffective.

When decisions taken by the lower levels are numerous as well as important an organisation can be regarded as greatly decentralised. Centralisation and Decentralisation Centralisation and decentralisation are relative terms, as seen from the existing status of various business enterprises. An organisation is centralised when decision­making authority is retained by higher management levels whereas it is decentralised when such authority is delegated. Complete centralisation would imply concentration of all decision making functions at the apex of the management hierarchy. Such a scenario would obviate the need for a management hierarchy. On the other complete decentralisation hand, Decentralisation Decentralisation refers to systematic effort to delegate to the lowest level all authority except that which can be exercised at central points.

Both the scenarios are unrealistic. An organisation can never be completely centralised or decent­ ralised. As it grows in size and comp­ lexity, there is a tendency to move towards decision decentralised making. This is because in large organisations those employees who are directly and closely involved with certain operations tend to have more knowledge about them than the top management which may only be indirectly associated with individual operations.

In centralised organisation because every decision is taken by the top management flow of information is slow as it has to traverse many levels. Response also takes time. This reduces the speed of decision making and makes it difficult for an enterprise to adapt to dynamic operating conditions. In a decentralised organisation, however,since decisions are taken at levels which are nearest to the points of action and there is no requirement for approval from many levels, the process is much faster. There are also less chances of information getting distorted because it doesn’t have to go through long channels. (iv) Relief to top management: Decentralisation diminishes the amount of direct supervision exercised by a superior over the activities of a subordinate because they are given the freedom to act and decide albeit within the limits set by the superior.

The extent of achievement of organisational objectives as well as the contribution of each department in meeting the overall objectives can be ascertained. Feedback from all levels helps to analyse variances and improve operations. In decentralisation, one of the challenges is the accountability of performance. In response to this challenge, better control systems are being evolved such as the balance score card and management infor­ mation system. Decentralisation compels the management innovative per formance to measur ement systems. As a conclusion, it must be noted that in spite of its benefits decentralisation should be applied with caution as it can lead to organisational disintegration if the departments start to operate on their own guidelines which may be contrary to the interest of the organisation.

Organisational structure is the framework within which managerial and operating tasks are performed. It can be functional or divisional.
