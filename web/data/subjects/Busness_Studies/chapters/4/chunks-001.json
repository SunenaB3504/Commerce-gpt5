All business firms would like to be successful, increase their sales and earn profits. All managers dream of these and strive to achieve their goals. But to turn these dreams into reality managers need to work hard in thinking about the future, in making business predictions and achieving targets. Dreams can be turned into reality only if business managers think in advance on what to do and how to do it. This is the essence of planning. concept Planning is deciding in advance what to do and how to do. It is one of the basic managerial functions.

Does it improve efficiency? After all why should we plan? These are numerous questions to which we would like to find solutions. Planning is certainly important as it tells us where to go, it provides direction and reduces the risk of uncertainty by preparing forecasts. The major benefits of planning are given below: (i) Planning provides directions: By stating in advance how work is to be done planning provides direction for action. Planning ens ures that the goals or objectives are clearly stated so that they act as a guide for deciding what action should be taken and in which direction. If goals are well defined, employees are aware of what the organisation has to do and what they must do to achieve those goals. Departments and Planning: Keeping the objective in view and being in action need to work towards achieving organisational goals.

The entire managerial process is concerned with accomplishing predeter mined goals through planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling. Planning provides the goals or standards against which actual performance is measured. By comparing actual performance with some standard, managers can know whether they have actually been able to attain the goals. If there is any deviation it can be corrected.

How do we go about making a plan? Since planning is an activity there are certain logical steps for every manager to follow. (i) Setting Objectives: The first and foremost step is setting objectives.

It could mean an increase in sales by 20% which could be objective of the entire organisation. How all dep artments would contribute to the organisational goals is the plan that is to be drawn up. Objectives should be stated clearly for all departments, units and employees. They give direction to all departments. Departments/ units then need to set their own objectives within the broad framework of the organisation’s philosophy. Objectives have to percolate down to each unit and employees at all levels. At the same time, managers must contribute ideas and participate in the objective setting process. They must also understand how their actions contribute to achieving objectives. If the end result is clear it becomes easier to work towards the goal.

(iii) Identifying alternative courses of action: Once objectives are set, assumptions are made. Then the next step would be to act upon them. There may be many ways to act and achieve objectives. All the alternative courses of action should be identified. The course of action which may be taken could be either routine or innovative. An innovative course may be adopted by involving more people and sharing their ideas. If the project is important, then more alternatives should be generated and thoroughly discussed amongst the members of the organisation. risky (iv) Evaluating alternative courses: The next step is to weigh the pros and cons of each alternative.

Major company policies are for all to know i.e., customers, clients, competitors etc., whereas minor polices are applicable to insiders and contain minute details of information vital to the employees of an organisation. But there has to be some basis for divulging information to others. define broad parameters within which a manager may function. The manager may use his/her discretion to interpret and apply a policy. For example, the decisions taken under a Purchase Policy would be in the nature of manufacturing or buying decisions. Should a company make or buy its requirements of packages, transport services, printing of stationery, water and power supply and other items? How should vendors be selected for procuring supplies? How many suppliers should a company make purchases from? What is the criteria for choosing suppliers.

For example, a sales budget may forecast the sales Ch_04.indd 104 08-08-2022 09:43:24\n\n105 of different products in each area for a particular month. A budget may also be prepared to show the number of workers required in the factory at peak production times. Since budget represents all items in numbers, it becomes easier to compare actual figures with expected figures and take corrective action subsequently. Thus, a budget is also a control device from which deviations can be taken care of. But making a budget involves forecasting, therefore, it clearly comes under planning. It is a fundamental planning instrument in many organisations. Let us take an example of Cash Budget. The cash budget is a basic tool in the management of cash.

Cash inflows would generally come from cash sales and the cash outflows would gener ally be the costs and expenses associated with the operations of the business. The net cash position is determined by the cash budget i.e., inflows minus (–) outflows = surplus or deficiency. The management has to hold adequate cash balances for various purposes. But at the same time, it should avoid excess balance of cash since it gives little or no return. The business has to assess and plan its need for cash with a degree of caution.
