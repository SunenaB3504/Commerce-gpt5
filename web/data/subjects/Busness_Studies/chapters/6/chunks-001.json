We have to make sure that they come back the next morning” (as stated by Narayana Murthy former, CEO of INFOSYS.) At a time when organisations are debating the strategic importance of their human resources, Infosys, a consulting and software services organisation, includes its human resources on its balance sheet to affirm their asset value. The rationale for this is as follows: “The long term success of a company is usually examined on certain financial and non-financial parameters. Human resources are among these new non-financial parameters that challenge the usefulness of evaluating corporate success solely on traditional measures. Human resources represent the collective expertise, innovation, leadership, entrepreneurial and managerial skills endowed in the employees of an organisation.” As a knowledge intensive company, Infosys recognises the value of its human assets in maintaining its competitive position. It realises that these assets can easily walk away, as competitors in India and abroad covet its IT talent. Consequently, the challenge facing Infosys is how to attract, retai",

Consequently, the challenge facing Infosys is how to attract, retain and develop its human assets in a highly competitive and dynamic environment? Most of the current human resource practices at Infosys result from the vision of the leaders and the culture that they have created. Narayana Murthy, known for his leadership and vision is the public image of Infosys. His leadership style is humble and straight-forward, quite uncommon in the world of Indian business. He believes in sharing wealth with his employees and in leading by example. In a knowledge-based business like Infosys, he sees the importance of consistency in rhetoric and action in empowering employees. He is credited with creating a culture of closeness and empowerment at Infosys. His management style, rare among Indian business leaders, is based on western management.

The rigour involves a host of tests and interviews, described later.

It may be in the form of direct financial payments like wages, salaries, incentives, commissions and bonuses and indirect payments like employer paid insurance and vacations. Direct payments financial are of two types: time based or performance based. A time based plan means salary and wages are paid either daily, weekly or monthly or annually. Performance based plans means salary/wages are paid according to piecework. For example, a worker may be paid according to the number of units produced by him/her.

Importance of Training and Development When jobs were simple, easy to learn and influenced to only a small degree by technological changes, there was little need for employees to upgrade or alter their skills.

Thus, as jobs have become more complex the importance of employee training has increased. Training and development help the the organisation and both individual.

It is a separate and specialised function and there are many aspects of human relations to be considered. It is the responsibility of all managers to directly deal and select people to work for the organisation. When the manager performs the staffing function his role is slightly limited. In small organisations, managers may perform all duties related to employees salaries, welfare and working conditions. But as organisations grow and number of persons employed increases, a separate department called the human resource department is formed which has specialists in the field to manage people. Human Resource Management includes many specialised activities and duties which the human resource personnel must perform. Evolution of HRM: Human resource management has replaced the traditional concept of labour welfare and personnel management.

Emergence of trade union movement led to the need of a person who could act as an effective link between the owners and workers. You may have observed that all these aspects are concerned with the human element in the industry as distinct from the mechanical side of the enterprise. Thus, staffing is an inherent part of human resource management as it is the practice of finding, evaluating and establishing a working relationship with people, for a purpose. Staffing Process: The prime concern of the staffing function in the management process is the timely fulfillment of the manpower requirements within an organisation. Estimating the Manpower Requirements: Performance of each job necessitates the appointment of a person with a specific set of educational qualifications, skills, prior experience and so on. Operationally, understanding the manpower requirements would necessitate workload analysis on the one hand and workforce analysis on the other.
