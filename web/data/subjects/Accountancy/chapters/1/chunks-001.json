Usage of computers and Information Technology (IT) enables a business to quickly, accurately and timely access the information that helps in decision-making. This sharpens the competitive edge and enhances profitability. The computer systems (Figure 1.1) works with the data which is processed by the hardware commanded by the user through software. The Computerised Accounting System (CAS) has the following components: Procedure: A logical sequence of actions to perform a task. Data: The raw fact (as input) for any business application. People Hardware: Computer, associated peripherals,: Users. and their network. Software: System software and Application software.

In accounting, a transaction consists of four data elements, such as name of account, accounting code, date of transaction and amount. transaction transaction transaction is a record of inflow and outflow of resources. The transaction transaction We may observe (Figure 1.3) how data (days worked and rate per day) is being (multiplied together) converted into information (amount to pay). The information may be viewed as data at one level; and when it is processed keeping in view the requirements of decision maker, it becomes the information at another level. 1.2 COMPONENTS OF CAS The manual system of accounting is traditionally most popular method of keeping records of financial transactions of an organ",

The claims of owners keep on changing due to success (profit) or failure (loss) of the firm. This is reflected by the income statement, which provides the summary of income and expenses of business for a given accounting period. Keeping this in view, the above equation can be re-written as: Assets = Liabilities + Capital + (Revenues – Expenses) Each component of the above equation can be divided into groups of accounts as follows: Revenue Revenue Revenue means inflow of resources, which results from the sale of goods or Revenue Revenue services in the normal course of business and increase in capital.

In order to maintain the hierarchical relationships between a group and its sub-groups, proper codification is required to ensure neatness of classification. 1.4.1 CODIFICATION OF ACCOUNTS According to Concise Oxford Dictionary, the term code means “a system of letter or figure with arbitrary meaning for brevity and for machine processing of information”. Thus, code is an identification mark. 6\n\nOverview of Computerised Accounting System Method of Codification The coding scheme of Account-heads should be such that it leads to grouping of accounts at various levels so as to generate Position Statement (Balance Sheet) and Statement of Profit and Loss (Profit-Loss Account).

Major advantage of such coding is that if the account codes are listed in ascending (i.e. increasing) order, these will be automatically listed as per the desired hierarchy. 1.4.1.1 Sequential Codes In Sequential Code, numbers and/or letters are assigned in consecutive order.

The first step is to develop a coding structure (scheme), which will be used to develop individual codes for each student. Development of coding structure requires identification (finalisation) of hierarchy of schooling system and that of various attributes (parameters) associated with a student. A hierarchy in such a situation could be as follows: Trust →→→→→ School →→→→→ Entry-year →→→→→ Stream →→→→→ Class →→→→→ Section →→→→→ Student The “Stream” could be science stream, commerce stream or general Stream. A class may be divided into more than one section when the number of admitted students increases the class capacity.

Summary Summary Summary Summary Summary • In Computerised Accounting System, accounting transactions are processed using computer system. A computer system includes hardware and software. Hardware includes Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), Monitor (Screen), Keyboard, Mouse, Hard Disk and CD/DVD for mass storage of data and Printer, etc. Software consists of set of instructions. Software can either be a System Software (a part of Computer System) or an Application Software. CAS uses Accounting Software. Accounting Software (such as Tally) is an example of Application Software. • Coding (for Account Head, Budget Head, Cost Centres, etc) is required in CAS. Coding first requires development of its structure. Coding Structure should be compatible with inherent structure of the element to be coded. For example, Account Head coding requires a hierarch",
