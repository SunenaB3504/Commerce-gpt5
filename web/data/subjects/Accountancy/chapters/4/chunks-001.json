In the previous chapter, you were introduced to the basic features of spreadsheet and use of spreadsheet in accounting. Quite often, we have to present the data for communication of the accounting information. If mass of data is presented it may not be easily in the raw understandable. It is rightly said, “A picture is worth more than thousand words”. This chapter seeks to explain the method of preparing graphs, charts and diagrams showing the data through the use of Excel as a tool. form, 4.1 GRAPHS AND CHARTS A graph is a pictorial representation of data, which has at least 2 dimensional relationship. Therefore, a graph has at least two axes, X and Y. X-axis is usually horizontal while Y-axis is vertical. A graph may either be a singleline graph or a multiple-line graph. For ease and enhancing of clarity, different types of lines and different shades of Colours can be used for preparing a multiple-line graph. A pie chart represents multiple",

(as given in Figure 4.4) The row totals (row number 11) gives the quarter wise total sales of products and the column totals (column number G) gives product wise total sales. The cell G11 gives over all total sales of the products for the year are entered in a worksheet.

In the graph sometimes we have to present negative values also, which can be put on the opposite side of the axes from origin (Figure 4.10). The intersection of both the axes (X-axis and Y-axis) is called the origin (O) of the graph. We can put on the right side of the origin positive values and on left side of the origin negative values of data on X-axis. Similarly upper ward side of origin shows positive values and down ward side of the origin shows negative values of data Y-axis.

It may be quicker and easier to create a chart immediately to see the possible relationship of variables to one another, rather than paging through raw data. Help to Present: We want to provide information in as little time as possible. Graphing plays a key role. It seems that there is no longer any time to sit and read a newspaper in order to find out what is going on. However, newspapers, such as The Economics Times and India Today magazines (which were early users of charting techniques), seem to understand this phenomena and provide graphs to convey and sum up ideas that they are making in their articles. Help to Convince: The same way that a graph can be used to present and explore different characteristics of data, it can also be used to convince. Graphs have the ability to take large amounts of information and make them into exhibitions that are easily used to persuade. 117\n\nComputerised Accounting",

Graphs are usually 2-dimensional. Sometimes 3-dimensional graphs are also used. • A graph may be either a singleline graph or a multi-line graph. Multi-line in a graph are distinguished either by using different shapes of line or different shapes and colors. • Other popular pictorial representations include Pie Chart and Bar Chart. Pie charts depict relative share of different elements. Bar charts are used to depict the comparison of absolute values of data (e.g. sales, production, etc.) at discrete points (e.g. time intervals, products, etc.). • MS-Excel 2007 (or simply Excel) provides a convenient facility to draw graphs and charts. The nomenclature used in Excel for charts (charts include graphs) is as follows: a. The Chart Area, b. The Plot Area covering the plot of values in the selected type of chart, c. The Data Points, d.
