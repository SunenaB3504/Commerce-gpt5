Making necessary deductions to calculate net salary, payroll accounting. • Calculation of deprecation by various methods. • Loan repayment, interest calculation. Introduction In the previous chapter, we have learned about the spreadsheet and its several features that can be used in business applications. In this chapter, we shall discuss the applications of spreadsheet (using Excel) to Payroll Accounting and some other select applications (Asset Management, and Loan Repayment). 3.1 PAYROLL ACCOUNTING Every employee is paid salary on a pre-determined date within the framework of employee contract and related personnel policy in force from time to time in an organisation. The computation of salary payment is based on the number of days an employee has worked, rate per grade of pay, rate of applied allowances and deductions to be made therefrom. The preparation of salary bill should provide for the following: • Maintaining payroll related data such as Employee No., Name, Attendance, Basic Pay, applicable Dearness an",

The following elements are important for salary computation and its payment: • CURRENT PAYROLL PERIOD (MONTH AND YEAR) • EARNINGS § Basic Pay (BP): It is the pay in the pay scale plus Grade Pay, but does not include Special Pay. § Grade Pay (GP):",

The advantage of preparing the template is that as a user puts in the values in the spreadsheet, the calculated results are shown correspondingly. A table giving the contents of various columns is a helpful tool to represent the template of a spreadsheet. The following example will explain this process.

Fixed assets are long-term assets and provide productive capability to the firm. The examples of fixed assets are land, building, plant & machinery, etc. It includes both tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets are physical in nature, which have form, shape and size. Intangible assets are resources capable of adding value but do not have a physical dimension such as patents, copyrights, trade mark, etc. The depreciation on fixed assets is provided to recognise the cost of the asset consumed during an accounting period since the life of such assets extends beyond single accounting year. Usually, depreciation is not provided on free hold land. Total Amount of Depreci",

Year-to-date depreciation is the accumulated depreciation from the date to which the asset is put to use till the current accounting year. Depreciation is calculated according to the policy of the organisation. There are basically two methods, namely the Straight Line Method (SLM) and the Written Down Value Method (WDV). We had studied depreciation in our previous standard (XIth Standard) in Accountancy Book Part I. We will recall that asset accounting requires maintenance of asset register, computation of depreciation and preparation of schedule of fixed assets for reporting in the balance sheet as part of the annual accounts.

The prescribed rates are different under two methods. For reporting purposes, corporate enterprises may use either of the method and applicable rates. Let us now understand the computation of depreciation using the two methods. 3.2.2.1 Straight Line Method (SLM) The following is the formula for computation of depreciation: • Acquisition Cost = Purchase Value + Other expenses, such as Transportation Expenses, Installation Expenses and Pre-operating Expenses • Total Depreciable Amount = Acquisition Cost - Salvage Value The salvage value of",

In this chapter, three examples have been taken to illustrate the ease and utility of spreadsheets. These examples are Payroll Calculation, Fixed Asset Accounting, and Loan Repayment Schedule. • The first step in using spreadsheet is to list out the elements of the application.

The absolute address is used for those cells whose content should not change while the formula containing such cells is copied to other cells. • If-function is also used in these applications. If-function is used to implement different action corresponding to different conditions. • The Excel functions SLN and DB are used for computation of depreciation using Straight Line Method (SLM) and Written Down Value Method (WDVM), respectively.
