A spreadsheet is a configuration of rows and columns. Rows are horizontal vectors while columns are vertical vectors. A spreadsheet is also known as a worksheet. It is used to record, calculate and compare numerical or financial data. Each value can either be an independent (i.e. basic) value or it may be derived on the basis of values of other variables. The derived value is the outcome of an arithmetic expression and/or a function (i.e. a formula). Spreadsheet application (sometimes referred to simply as spreadsheet) is a computer program that allows us to add (i.e. enter) and process data. We shall understand spreadsheet with the help of MS-Excel (or simply, Excel), which is one of the Microsoft Office Suite of software. Figure 2.1 The current version of Excel is Excel 2007 and has a completely redesigned user interface. The Excel 2007 is now designed with a series of horizontal tabs known as “Ribbon” (Figure 2.1).

A workbook is a collection of a number of “Worksheets” (Figure 2.2). By default, three sheets, namely Sheet 1, Sheet 2, and Sheet 3 are available to users. At a time, only one worksheet can be made as “Active Worksheet” and that worksheet is available to a user for carrying out operations. An active worksheet’s name will be shown in bold letters in the “Sheet Tab” at the bottom left of the screen. Additional sheets can be added, if required, by clicking on the icon (which orksheet orksheet works as Insert! W! W! W! W!

The other cell reference is absolute cell reference which consists of the column letter and row number surrounded by dollar ($) signs e.g. $C$4. An absolute cell reference is used when we want a cell reference to stay fixed on specific cell, which means that when a formula or function is copied and pasted to other cells, the cell references in the formula or function do not change.

A function involves four main issues: • Name of the function • The purpose of the function • The function needs what argument(s) in order to carry its assignment. • The result of the function. Figure 2.8(b) A function is a built in set of formulas which starts with an = “equal to sign” such as = FunctionName(Data). The data (or argument in proper terminology) includes a range of cells. SUM (), AVERAGE () and COUNT () are common functions and relatively easy to understand. They each apply to a range of cells containing numbers (or blank but not text) and return either the arithmetic total of the numbers, the average mean value or the quantity of values in the range. For Example: The SUM or AutoSum ( ∑) function is the most basic and one of the common user functions. It is used to get the addition of Figure 2.9(a) Figure 2.9(b) various numbers or the contents of various cells.

The quickest way to get help on a function whose name (e.g. SUMIF) when we entered on formula bar followed by equal to sign then double-click the function’s name that appears in the strip (as shown in the figure 2.14). We will learn some of the useful function with the help of examples. Figure 2.14 2.1.4.1 Date and Time Function 1. TODAY () is the function for today’s date in the blank worksheet. TODAY – Returns the serial number of the current date. The serial number is the date-time code used by Excel for date and time calculations. Times are represented as fractions of a day. By default January 1, 1900 is serial number 1. Thus, January 1, 2009 is serial number 39814 (because it is 39814 days after January 1, 1900). 2. NOW () is similar function but it includes the current time also (Figure 2.15). 3. DAY(serial_number) function returns the day of a date as an integer ranging from1 to 31. For example, if A5",

Criteria it is the criteria in the form of a number, expression, or text that defines which cells will be added, e.g. criteria can be expressed 1500, “1500”, “>1500” or “Books”. Sum_range are the actual cells to sum. e.g. There are sum Asset Values (D2:D5) and related to each asset values there are deprecation values (E2:E5). Using SUMIF function we have to calculate the sum of depreciation for those Asset Values which are more than 1, 70,000/-.

In both the cases data should be correct, accurate and should be in proper format. This means that data should be validated, corrected and can be display in proper format.

Excel aligns text to the left side of the cell. • Values (numbers) are generally raw numbers or dates. s Whole value: If the data is a whole value, such as 34 or 5763, Excel aligns the data to the right side of the cell. s Vale with a decimal: If the data is a decimal value, Excel aligns the data to the right side of the cell, including the decimal point, with the exception of a trailing 0. For example, if we enter 246.75, then 246.75 displays; such as 246.70, will display as 246.7.

We can configure data validation rules for cells data that will not allow users to enter invalid data, There may be warning messages when users tries to type wrong data in the cell. The messages also guide users to what input is expected for the cell, and instructions to correct any errors. 50\n\nSpreadsheet Data validation is invaluable because it is necessary that data must be accurate and consistent. The different methods for data validation are as follows: • Create a Drop down List – By this option pre-defined items names list is referred and restrict the users to select accordingly – e.g. In the organisation for a business application we want to restrict the Figure 2.42 users not to enter the names of departments other than Sales, Finance, R&D, Oper",

On the Ribbon there are several tools and shortcuts to format spreadsheets effectively.

We can apply conditional formatting to a cell range, a table, or a PivotTable report. There are important differences to understand when we use conditional formatting on a PivotTable report (Figure 2.52(k). • The benefits of conditional formatting (Figure 2.52m) To analyse data, we often ask ourselves some questions, such as: Where are the exceptions in a summary of data over the past five years? What is the trend in data over the past two years? Who is responsible for such results during this month? What is the overall age distribution of employees? Which products have greater than 10% revenue increases from year to year? Who are the highest performing and lowest performing students in the class? Figure 2.52(m) Conditional formatting helps to answer these questions by making it easy to highlight interesting cells or ranges of cells, emphasise unusual values, and visualise data by using data bars, colour scales, and icon sets. A conditional format changes the appearance of a cell range based on a condition (or criteria). If the condition i",

If the condition is true, the cell range is formatted based on that condition; if the conditional is false, the cell range is not formatted based on that condition. 61\n\nComputerised Accounting System • Format all cells by using a colour scale Colour scales are visual guides that help us to understand data distribution and their variation. A colour scale helps us to compare a range of cells by using a gradation of different colours. The shade of the colour represents higher or lower values. For example, in a green colour are higher value cells and red colour for lower value cells. If one or more cells in the range contain a formula that returns an error, the conditional formatting is not applied to the entire range. To ensure that the conditional formatting is applied to the entire range, use an IS or IFERROR function to return a value other than an error value. 1.

The computeried spreadsheet can be formatted with different print layouts. It allows working with rows and columns of numbers and use formula to do “what if” calculations. The spreadsheet gives considerable power and flexibility in entering and editing information, setting up calculations with formula and functions, and printing the results. It has rows that are horizontal lines of information that are numbered on the left-hand side of the Excel workbook. Columns are vertical lines of information and are identified by letters along the top of the",

Columns are vertical lines of information and are identified by letters along the top of the spreadsheet. Rows and columns intersect to form cells. A cell is addressed by the column and row position, for example B4 is the intersection of column b and row 4. • In the earliest spreadsheets, cells were a simple two-dimensional grid. Over time, the model has been expanded to include a third dimension, and in some cases a series of named grids, called sheets. • In any worksheet or spreadsheet a cell is the smallest element which may contain a value or a formula or a function or it may simply be left empty.

The older “R1C1” reference style consists of the letter R, the row number, the letter C, and the column number; relative row or column numbers are indicated by enclosing the number in square brackets. Most current spreadsheets use the A1 style, some providing the R1C1 style as a compatibility option. When the computer calculates a formula in one cell to update the displayed value of that cell, cell reference(s) in that cell, naming some other cell(s), cause the computer to fetch the value of the named cell(s). • A reference to a range of cells is typically of the form (A1:A6) which specifies all the cells in the range A1 through to A6.
