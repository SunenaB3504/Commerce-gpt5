    "text": "Accounting Ratios 5 Financial statements aim at providing financial information about a business enterprise to meet the information needs of the decision-makers. Financial statements prepared by a business enterprise in the corporate sector are published and are available to the decision-makers. These statements provide financial data which require analysis, comparison and interpretation for taking decision by the external as well as internal users of accounting information. This act is termed as financial statement analysis. It is regarded as an integral and important part of accounting. As indicated in the previous chapter, the most commonly used techniques of financial statements analysis are comparative statements, common size statements, trend analysis, accounting ratios and cash flow analysis. The first three have been discussed in detail in the previous chapter. This chapter covers the technique of accounting ratios for analysing the information contained in financial statements for assessing the solvency, efficiency and profitability of the enterprises. 5.1 Meaning of Accounting Ratios As stated earlier, accounting ratios are an important tool of financial statements analys",

A ratio is a mathematical number calculated as a reference to relationship of two or more numbers and can be expressed as a fraction, proportion, percentage and a number of times. When the number is calculated by referring to two accounting numbers derived from LEARNING OBJECTIVES After studying this chapter, you will be able to: • explain the meaning, objectives and limitations of accounting ratios; • identify the various types of ratios commonly used; • calculate various ratios to assess solvency, liquidity, efficiency and profitability of the firm; • interpret the various ratios calculated for intra-firm and inter-firm comparisons.\n\nAccounting Ratios 195 the financial statements, it is termed as accounting ratio.

This ratio is termed as gross profit ratio. Similarly, inventory turnover ratio may be 6 which implies that inventory turns into ‘Revenue from Operations’ six times in a year. It needs to be observed that accounting ratios exhibit relationship, if any, between accounting numbers extracted from financial statements. Ratios are essentially derived numbers and their efficacy depends a great deal upon the basic numbers from which they are calculated. Hence, if the financial statements contain some errors, the derived numbers in terms of ratio analysis would also present an erroneous scenario. Further, a ratio must be calculated using numbers which are meaningfully correlated. A ratio calculated by using two unrelated numbers would hardly serve any purpose. For example, the furniture of the business is Rs. 1,00,000 and Purchases are Rs. 3,00,000. The ratio of purchases to furniture is 3 (3,00,000/1,00,000) but it hardly has any relevance.

It provides users with crucial financial information and points out the areas which require investigation. Ratio analysis is a technique which involves regrouping of data by application of arithmetical relationships, though its interpretation is a complex matter. It requires a fine understanding of the way and the rules used for preparing financial statements. Once done effectively, it provides a lot of information which helps the analyst: 1. To know the areas of the business which need more attention; 2. To know about the potential areas which can be improved with the effort in the desired direction; 3. To provide a deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency and efficiency levels in the business; 4. To provide information for making cross-sectional analysis by comparing the performance with the best industry standards; and 5. To provide information derived from financ",

Thus, the limitations of financial statements also form the limitations of the ratio analysis. Hence, to interpret the ratios, the user should be aware of the rules followed in the preparation of financial statements and also their nature and limitations. The limitations of ratio analysis which arise primarily from the nature of financial statements are as under: 1. Limitations of Accounting Data: Accounting data give an unwarranted impression of precision and finality. In fact, accounting data “reflect a combination of recorded facts, accounting conventions and personal judgements which affect them materially. For example, profit of the business is not a precise and final figure. It is merely an opinion of the accountant based on application of accounting policies.

The soundness of the judgement necessarily depends on the competence and integrity of those who make them and on their adherence to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Conventions”. Thus, the financial statements may not reveal the true state of affairs of the enterprises and so the ratios will also not give the true picture. Ignores Price-level Changes: The financial accounting is based on stable money measurement principle. It implicitly assumes that price level changes are either non-existent or minimal. But the truth is otherwise. We are normally living in inflationary economies where the power of money declines constantly. A change in the price-level makes analysis of financial statement of different accounting years meaningless because accounting records ignore changes in value of money. Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects: Accounting provides information about quantitative (or monetary) aspects of business.

Lack of ability to resolve problems: Their role is essentially indicative and of whistle blowing and not providing a solution to the problem. 3. Lack of standardised definitions: There is a lack of standardised definitions of various concepts used in ratio analysis. For example, there is no standard definition of liquid liabilities. Normally, it includes all current liabilities, but sometimes it refers to current liabilities less bank overdraft. 4. Lack of universally accepted standard levels: There is no universal yardstick which specifies the level of ideal ratios. There is no standard list of the levels universally acceptable, and, in India, the industry averages are also not available. 5.

As such, the alternative classification (functional classification) based on the purpose for which a ratio is computed, is the most commonly used classification which is as follows: 1.

These are analysed by looking at the amounts of current assets and current liabilities in the balance sheet. The two ratios included in this category are current ratio and liquidity ratio. 5.6.1 Current Ratio Current ratio is the proportion of current assets to current liabilities. It is expressed as follows: Current Ratio = Current Assets: Current Liabilities or Current Assets Current Liabilities Current assets include current investments, inventories, trade receivables (debtors and bills receivables), cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and advances and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax and accrued income, etc. Current liabilities include short-term borrowings, trade payables (creditors and bills payables), other current liabilities and short-term provisions.

A very high current ratio implies heavy investment in current assets which is not a good sign as it reflects under utilisation or improper utilisation of resources. A low ratio endangers the business and puts it at risk of facing a situation where it will not be able to pay its short-term debt on time. If this problem persists, it may affect firm’s credit worthiness adversely. Normally, it is safe to have this ratio within the range of 2:1. 5.6.2 Quick or Liquid Ratio It is the ratio of quick (or liquid) asset to current liabilities. It is expressed as Quick ratio = Quick Assets: Current Liabilities or Quick Assets Current Liabilities The quick assets are defined as those assets which are quickly convertible into cash. While calculating quick assets we exclude the inventories at the end and other current assets such as prepaid expenses, advance tax, etc., from the current assets.

It is computed as follows: Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Long-term Debt/Capital Employed (or Net Assets) Capital employed is equal to the long-term debt + shareholders’ funds.

(i) Further issue of equity shares (ii) Cash received from debtors (iii) Sale of goods on cash basis (iv) Redemption of debentures (v) Purchase of goods on credit. Solution: The change in the ratio depends upon the original ratio. Let us assume that external funds are Rs. 5,00,000 and internal funds are Rs. 10,00,000. Now we will analyse the effect of given transactions on debt equity ratio. (i) Assume that Rs. 1,00,000 worth of equity shares are issued. This will increase the internal funds to Rs. 11,00,000. The new ratio will be 0.45: 1 (5,00,000/11,00,000). Thus, it is clear that further issue of equity shares decreases the debt-equity ratio. (ii) Cash received from debtors will leave the internal and external funds unchanged as this will only affect the composition of current assets. Hence, the debt-equity ratio will remain unchanged.\n\n212 Acco",
