This meant that the Government of India had to take a series of steps such as the establishment of the Planning Commission and announcement of five year plans. An overview of the goals of five year plans and a critical appraisal of the merits and limitations of planned development has been covered in this unit.\n\n1 INDIAN ECONOMY ON THE EVE OF INDEPENDENCE After studying this chapter, the learners will • • become familiar with the state of the Indian economy in 1947, the year of India’s Independence understand the factors that",

The structure of India’s present-day economy is not just of current making; it has its roots steeped in history, particularly in the period when India was under British rule which lasted for almost two centuries before India finally won its independence on 15 August 1947.
